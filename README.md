# MAGIC_8_BALL
The Magic 8 Ball is a classic toy that provides answers to yes-or-no questions. In this Flutter application, we will create a digital version of the Magic 8 Ball using a 3D model and animations.

First, we will create a screen with a black background and a 3D model of the Magic 8 Ball in the center.

Next, we will add a text widget inside the 3D model to display the answer to the user's question. We will create a list of possible answers and randomly select one when the user clicks the device.

Overall, this Magic 8 Ball application will provide users with a fun and interactive way to get answers to their questions.
